Pokémon TCG Enhanced Changelog
V1.0.1
Fixed some Text typos.
All descriptions that mentioned "PKMN" now mention "Pokémon". (Altough i recommend using "PKMN" if you want to make Custom Cards, it helps you save some unnecesary lines)
-----------Technical Stuff------------------------
In ‎src/engine/game_loop.asm there are now 2 comments on about how to use the lowercase font, in line 15 and 41.
Due to some space restrictions, Text05da and Text0683 where moved to text13.asm

--------------------------------------------------
V1.0:
• All text in the cards have been changed to be more simpler and easier to understand.
• At the start of the game you can choose whether to play as Mark or Mint, exactly like in the Sequel!
• Now the start of the game is a little bit faster, the Tutorial is now optional and Text Speed is set to 5.
• The Sprites of the Main Duelists of the Game have been replaced by those of the Sequel. (Many of those were modified by me, especially Mint's Sprite)
• Phantom Venusaur can be found in MYSTERY Packs, and Phantom Mew in LABORATORY.
• Sam now give 50 Energy Cards in his special booster
• Fixed Various Bugs and Code Errors from the original game.

-----------Technical Stuff------------------------
• Added a new GFX Section (SECTION "Gfx 13", ROMX).
• The Effect Commands and Effect Functions have been optimized little, mainly removing unnecesary parts and duplicated effects, so you should have more space there. (this also applies to the Text.)
